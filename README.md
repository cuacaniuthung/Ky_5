# Ky_5

This repository was created to store and organize learning materials for semester 5 of the academic program. Specifically, it focuses on the main subjects such as DPL302m, SEG301, and TMG301, facilitating easy management and access to resources. Each folder corresponding to a subject will contain complete practice exercises, guided labs, along with some supplementary reference materials such as lecture slides, notes, and other supporting resources. This repo not only serves personal learning but can also be shared with the student community to support each other.
